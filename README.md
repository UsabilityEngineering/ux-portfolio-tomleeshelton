# Tom Shelton's UX Portfolio

![A Picture of Me](assets/selfie.jpg)

Hey, I'm Tom, and this is my portfolio page for Usability Engineering. I'm majoring in Communication Design, and hope to pick up a lot of valuable UX experience from this course. I'm a creative person with a technical side, and hope to work on site design and interfaces in the future. I also have previous experience working on virtual-reality user interfaces at my last job.

In my spare time I enjoy biking around Chico, travelling, drawing, and being around friends and family.
